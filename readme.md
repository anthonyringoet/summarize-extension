# Quickly summarize web page contents

> This is a Firefox extension that summarizes the content of the current webpage on-demand using the OpenAI API (GPT-3.5). Users need to provide their OpenAI API key in the extension settings.

You can load the extension in Firefox using the `about:debugging` page as a temporary add-on for testing.

The code was written with ChatGPT as my sidekick, which was a pretty cool experience.

### Usage

1. Install the extension in Firefox using the `about:debugging` page for testing.
2. Once installed, save your OpenAI key in the [extension settings overview](about:addons).
3. Navigate to any webpage, select text to summarize.
4. Click the extension icon to open the popup. Click "Summarize selection" to generate a summary of the contents in a new tab.
